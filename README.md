*Clostridioides difficile* (*C. difficile*) infections (CDI) are a leading cause of healthcare-associated infections (HAI) worldwide, accounting for over 223,000 hospitalized cases and 12,800 deaths annually in the United States. A significant challenge in identifying environmental reservoirs for in HAIs is the overwhelming number of potential fomites. In this study, we quantified rates of *C. difficile* spread across two ICUs and add critical data to help explaincontextualize the crucial role environmental surfaces and HCP hands play in patient-to-patient transmission. We identified a natural transmission threshold of ≤2 SNPs, and applying our threshold, we identified seven 7 transmission clusters involving 22 unique occupant stays. In other words, 7.7% (22/287) of all occupant stays admitted to these ICUs were implicated in *C. difficile* transmission (Figure 1). Importantly, 71.4% of these transmission clusters would have been missed without the expanded sampling of environmental surfaces and HCP hands because they did not include patient body site isolates from multiple occupant stays.

Our study is among the first to provide direct genomic evidence for the role of environmental surfaces and HCP hands in *C. difficile* transmission within an HCF. We demonstrated significantly more *C. difficile* movement than had been previously appreciated. Although we highlight the role of environmental surfaces in transmission, we did not find a single reservoir responsible for seeding infections across the wards. Our observations provide novel insights into pathogen transmission dynamics that can inform infection control practices by highlighting the critical importance of hand hygiene, even when CDI is not suspected. 

## Abstract
*Clostridioides difficile* (*C. difficile*) is among the most prevalent healthcare-associated pathogens worldwide. Controlling it remains a critical challenge, due, in part, to spore viability on surfaces. To quantify transmission of *C. difficile* within healthcare facilities and evaluate the roles of environmental surfaces and healthcare personnel (HCP) hands in *C. difficile* movement. In 2018, we conducted a 13-week longitudinal, observational study in two ICUs in acute care hospital in Utah, with daily culture-based sampling of patient body sites, room environmental surfaces, HCP hands, and shared environmental surfaces. Both toxigenic and non-toxigenic *C. difficile* strains were selected for whole genome sequencing (WGS) and included in our analysis. A total of 7,000 samples were collected across all surfaces. Environmental surfaces and HCP hands were sampled daily for all occupied rooms. Of the 278 unique ICU admissions, 177 patients consented to body site sampling and were sampled. The primary outcome was the identification of transmission clusters based on genomic relatedness between isolates from patients, environmental surfaces, and HCP hands. Clusters were defined as isolates with ≤2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between them. Sampling patients, their environment, and healthcare personnel (HCP) hands revealed nearly 8% of all patients had *C. difficile* linked to other admissions and 57% of transmission clusters bridged non-overlapping patient-stays. Including environmental surfaces and HCP hands, we identified 3.6-fold higher *C. difficile* movement than with patient sampling alone, highlighting environmental surfaces as reservoirs. Our results challenge the idea that nosocomial transmission is not a primary source of acquisition and underscores the importance of hand hygiene and environmental decontamination. Our study reinforces the need to include environmental surfaces and HCP hands in future work characterizing the burden of nosocomial transmission. Understanding the transmission pathways of *C. difficile* within healthcare facilities, particularly the roles of environmental surfaces and healthcare personnel (HCP) hands, is critical to improving infection control measures.
